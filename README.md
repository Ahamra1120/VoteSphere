# VoteSphere
General Elections (PEMILU) and the democratic process are important cornerstones in the Indonesian government system which is based on the principles of justice, participation/public participation and transparency. At MAN 2 Jakarta, the election of the MPK-OSIS (Student Councils) chairman is still carried out conventionally, which is considered less efficient considering advances in technology and information. In using research and development (R&D) methods using the ADDIE development model, the VoteSphere voting tool was created. This tool uses ESP32 as a microcontroller, and every incoming data will be validated using an RFID Card. The data that has been validated will then be sent to the PHPMyAdmin Database and the data that has been collected will then be displayed on the website in real time. This tool has benefits for conventional election systems, such as conducting elections more effectively, making it easier to calculate election results, not disturbing the teaching and learning process, and creating elections that are LUBER and JURDIL.
